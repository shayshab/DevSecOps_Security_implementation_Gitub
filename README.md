# DevSecOps Security Toolchain

A comprehensive DevSecOps implementation demonstrating operational toolchains that integrate security scanning, compliance monitoring, and automated testing with secure deployment pipelines.

## 🚀 Features

- **Security Scanning**: SAST, DAST, dependency scanning, and container security
- **Compliance Monitoring**: Policy as Code with Open Policy Agent (OPA)
- **Automated Testing**: Security tests, integration tests, and vulnerability assessments
- **Secure Pipelines**: GitHub Actions with security tool integration
- **Infrastructure Security**: Terraform with security best practices
- **Monitoring & Alerting**: Security event monitoring and incident response
